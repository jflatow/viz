The Canvas
==========

The user-defined `paintRecord` function always receives the current *canvas* as its third argument.
The canvas methods are exported directly to JavaScript using the `WebScripting protocol`_.
Basically, this protocol defines a mapping between Objective-C messages and JavaScript functions.
See `Canvas.h` and `Canvas.h` for details about the canvas internals.

Listed below are the most interesting canvas functions for painting with viz::

       height();
       width();
       blink();
       clear();

       clearRectWithWidth_andHeight_atX_andY_(width, height, x, y);
       fillRectWithWidth_andHeight_atX_andY_(width, height, x, y);

       paintArcWithRadius_andStartAngle_andEndAngle_atX_andY_(radius, startAngle, endAngle, x, y);
       paintCircleWithRadius_atX_andY_(radius, x, y);

       paintLineFromX_andY_toX_andY_(x1, y1, x2, y2);
       paintRectWithWidth_andHeight_atX_andY_(width, height, x, y);

       setFillColorR_G_B_A_(r, g, b, a);
       setStrokeColorR_G_B_A_(r, g, b, a);

       setText_(text);

       strokeRectWithWidth_andHeight_atX_andY_(width, height, x, y);
