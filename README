What is viz?
------------

viz is a utility for visualizing streams of data records.
Although viz is designed to operate according to the UNIX philosophy, it is also intimately tied to Mac OS X.
viz is tightly coupled to the OS X graphics layers, in order to provide high-quality visualization and interaction.


Invoking viz
------------

It is possible to invoke multiple instances of viz (as is true of any OS X application).
However, like most applications built for OS X, the usual behavior is to launch only a single instance.
Instances of viz may be invoked with a particular set of options which will only take effect during that instance.
If changes are made to user defaults for a particular instance after it has been launched, the changes will be persisted.


Building viz
------------

xcodebuild install prefix=/usr/local

This will build viz.app and install the command line utility under `prefix`/bin, in this case /usr/local/bin.
The viz.app will get built and installed under /tmp/viz.dst, the application can be copied from there to the Applications folder.
To install viz.app to ~/Applications, set DSTROOT=/ as follows:

xcodebuild install prefix=/usr/local DSTROOT=/
